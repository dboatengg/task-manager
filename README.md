## About this Project
Task Manager is one of the early projects I created to practice using React with Firebase. It's a simple responsive ToDo application where you can add and delete tasks. You can also mark tasks as completed.

Kindly note that every task you add is public and can be viewed by other visitors on the site. Please do not add sensitive or confidential information as tasks.
